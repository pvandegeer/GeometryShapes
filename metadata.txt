about=This plugin draws basic geometry shapes with user defined measurements and also allows free drawing. Integrates in
the digitizing toolbar. Options are rectangles, squares, ovals, and circles. Use shift to fix the aspect ratio and
create perfect squares and circles.
    Currently the dimensions are dictated by the default map units of the project CRS which can be degrees. This will
change to QGIS measurement units in a forthcoming release.
