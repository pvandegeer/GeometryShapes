about=This plugin draws basic geometry shapes with user defined measurements and also allows free drawing. Integrates in the digitizing toolbar. Options are rectangles, squares, ovals, and circles. Use shift to fix the aspect ratio and create perfect squares and circles.

    Currently the dimensions are dictated by the default map units of the project CRS which can be degrees. This will change to QGIS measurement units in a forthcoming release.

changelog=
    0.8 Configurable # of segments for circles (pull request 6)
        Drop suport for QGis 2
        Bug fixes:
        * Hopefully fix locale setting error on fresh QGis install (fix bug #13)
        * Set default values for attributes (fix bug #10)
        * Check for vector layer type (fix bug #7) 
    0.7 Handle layer CRS that is different from the project CRS. Also don't prompt for non existing attributes.
    0.6 Add Undo and make behave like the default polygon tool (fix issue 1 and a minor bug)
    0.5 Make QGis3 compatible
    0.4 Added ovals
        Use Shift-key to switch between squares/rectangles and circles/ovals
        Tips and feedback through gui
        Lots of minor improvements
    0.3 Add basic support for circles
    0.2 Allow for geometries with fields
